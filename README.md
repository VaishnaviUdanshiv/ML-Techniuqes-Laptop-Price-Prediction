# Machine-Learning
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models for 
laptop price prediction. The dataset used in this study contains information about various laptop 
features, including the company, type, screen resolution, CPU, GPU, operating system, screen size, 
weight, and price. The primary objective is to build accurate regression models that can predict the 
price of a laptop based on its specifications. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the aim is to 
develop models that can effectively capture the relationships between laptop features and their 
corresponding prices. In this project, we will employ feature engineering techniques to preprocess 
the dataset, transforming categorical variables into numerical representations and standardizing 
numerical features for better model performance. We will train and evaluate three machine learning 
models, namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using evaluation metrics such 
as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score. The results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of feature engineering in improving the predictive accuracy of the models.
